# Citrus_segregation_landscapes
This repository provides reproducible analytical workflows for Citrus hindsii genomic and genetic analyses, focusing on segregation distortion during apomixis-to-sexual transition, including genome assembly/pangenome construction, haplotype shuffling mapping, and exponential decay modeling for single-/multi-locus segregation distortion.
